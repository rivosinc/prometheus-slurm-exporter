# Slurm Exporter

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/rivosinc/prometheus-slurm-exporter)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/rivosinc/prometheus-slurm-exporter)
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/rivosinc/prometheus-slurm-exporter)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/rivosinc/prometheus-slurm-exporter)

Inspired by the now unmaintained prometheus slurm [exporter](https://github.com/vpenso/prometheus-slurm-exporter). We implement in some form or another, most of the
metrics from the previously maintained exporter. We have not yet added GPU or fairshare support, although we will be more than happy to accept contributions for those.
This exporter supports `--json` output from cli. Note that the plugin supported is `openapi/v0.0.37` not `data_parser`, which ships with the most modern version of slurm.
While in production we've found that the cli fallback (defining a custom json format from the slurm cmdline) performs far better and more reliably than parsing with the slurm
provided json output. Thus, this is now the default mode of deployment as it also doesn't require any compiled plugins. We are keeping the openapi support for slurmrestd
support in the future. We also support client-side throttling. In practice, users can have multiple prometheus instances polling the same exporter without worrying about
overwhelming slurmctld. The final addition we've added is tracing support. If enabled, users can publish process stats for their jobs and track alloc vs live usage for
profiling and optimization consideration.

### Getting Started
Golang >=20 is required. From there, follow the `justfile` or run `just prod` to start a dev server.
You can also install the exporter directly with `go install github.com/rivosinc/prometheus-slurm-exporter@latest`. Then you can run `prometheus-slurm-exporter -h`.

```bash
# example installation
$ go install github.com/rivosinc/prometheus-slurm-exporter@v1.3.1
# or if you like living on the edge
$ go install github.com/rivosinc/prometheus-slurm-exporter@latest
# if not already added, ensure
$ export PATH="$PATH:$GOPATH/bin"
$ prometheus-slurm-exporter -h
...
# probably the most common invocation
$ prometheus-slurm-exporter -slurm.cli-fallback
```

Example prometheus config:

```yaml
  - job_name: 'slurm-prod-scraper'
    scrape_interval: 30s # For the best experience, this should be at least 2x POLL_LIMIT
    scrape_timeout: 30s
    static_configs:
        - targets: ['path.to.exporter:9092']
```

We've also uploaded a example [dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/19835-slurm-exporter) to help users get started. If the link doesn't work try import by Id: `19835`

### Job Tracing
Job tracing is default disabled. To enable it simply add `-trace.enabled` to the arg list. This will enable endpoint `/trace` by default (configurable, see help page).
With trace enabled jobs can _POST_ proccess metrics to the exporter. This adds a memory overhead that is proportional to the amount of jobs enabled for tracing.
When writing wrapper scripts to upload job data, ensure that they publish data in a json schema that the exporter can understand and that it uploads proc info at a rate thats faster than the prometheus scrape time (I reccomend 2x the prometheus scrape interval). Wrapped jobs can now be traced on Grafana so users can see job resource usage
alongside a jobs allocated resources. Here is an example wrapper script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH -p <partition>
#SBATCH ...other options

module load python3

export SLURM_EXPORTER=http://path.to.exporter:8092/trace
export SAMPLE_RATE=5

python3 ./wrappers/proctrac.py $@
```

We can then get dispatch jobs with our wrapper script as such `sbatch srun_wrapper.sh sleep 300`. With tracing enabled, we get the following visualization.

Feel free to write your own wrappers. To use ours, ensure slurm nodes have access to `pip3 install psutil requests`. Currently, we do not plan to support any auth modes between the wrappers and the exporter, although contributions are welcome.
